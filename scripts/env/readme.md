The `scripts/env/` folder contain sample `.env` files for the deployment scripts in the `scripts/` folder.

For example, the file `scripts/env/deployDjedContract/milkomeda.env` contain the parameters that were used to deploy Milkomeda Djed Osiris on the Milkomeda blockchain.

To run a deployment script, create an `.env` file in the `scripts/` folder with the desired parameters and then run the script.
